\chapter{Known key leak techniques}
\label{ch:known_key_leak_techniques}
Scientific work about key leak techniques on a source code base has been done in \cite{7180102}. 
The main work consists in the application of different mechanisms to uncover different types of secrets.
These are keyword search, pattern-based search and heuristics-driven filtering.
This work mainly concentrates on the detection of API tokens from Amazon and Facebook.
	
The first approach called keyword search focuses on fixed strings in files such as a RSA private key. 
RSA private keys always contains a prefix like the following.
\begin{lstlisting}
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
\end{lstlisting}
This keyword search approach works well if the secrets contain fixed string prefixes. 
Nontheless it is not sufficient for private keys without fixed prefixes.
Due to this fact the referenced paper \cite{7180102} is more focusing on pattern-based search. 

Pattern-based search works on the basis of regular expressions and is therefore suitable for strings with a fixed schema.
Tokens provided by cloud providers and other dedicated vendors follow a fixed scheme. Therefore these tokens are recognized by regular language classes.
However this pattern-based search method also has disadvantages in the form of false-positives.
These false-positive issue is handled in \cite{7180102} by heuristics and source slicing.

Heuristics have been tested by looking at cases where a matching secret key appears within 5 lines of each other. 
This is usually precise but there is a risk of missing the key where credentials are not close together.
Another tested heuristically approach to reduce false-positives is trying and guessing whether they are auto-generated or hand-written. 
An additional framework was used to follow this approach. 
The false-positive rate was successful decreased as noticed in \cite{7180102}.

The following concept will use the keyword search and pattern-based search to detect secrets. 
It is only intended to prove that the recognition of secrets in container images is generally possible. 
In theory an extension of heuristics-driven filtering improves the results if the detection of secrets in container images is possible.

The following chapter only adapts these key mechanism keyword search and pattern-based search in the theoretical concept to detect secrets in container images with Docker as an example.
