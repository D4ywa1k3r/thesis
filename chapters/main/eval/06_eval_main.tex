\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:eval}
In this chapter the prototypical implementation of image analysis is evaluated. 
The input for the prototype consists of self-made images as well as images from public container registers. 
The self-made images will purposely contain RSA and AWS secrets while it is not clear if the public ones will contain these types of secrets. 
The goal is to show that the prototype works in general and also for public images.
Therefore a number of public images have to be scanned to find secrets.
The results of the locally images and public images are briefly and concisely presented.
The next section of this chapter starts with the development of self-created Docker images.
