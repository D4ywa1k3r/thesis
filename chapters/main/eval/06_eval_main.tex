\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:eval}
This chapter evaluates the prototypical implementation of the previous chapter \ref{ch:practical_realization}. 
Locally self-made Docker images and public Docker images from a container-registry provides the input to be processed by the prototype. The self-made images will purposely contain the RSA and AWS secrets while it is not clear if the public ones will contain these types of secrets. The goal is to prove that the prototype is working for public images as well.
The results of the locally images are shown and a final result in relation to public images is briefly and concisely presented.
These results provide a good basis for a subsequent discussion which take place in the last section of the chapter.
The next section of this chapter starts with self-created Docker images.
