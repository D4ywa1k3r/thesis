\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:eval}
This chapter evaluates the prototypical implementation of the previous chapter \ref{ch:practical_realization}. 
The input for the prototype are self-built images as well as pictures from public container registries. The self-made images will purposely contain RSA and AWS secrets while it is not clear if the public ones will contain these types of secrets. The goal is to prove that the prototype is working for public images as well. Therefore a number of public images has to be scanned to find secrets.
The results of the locally images and public images are briefly and concisely presented.
The next section of this chapter starts with self-created Docker images.
