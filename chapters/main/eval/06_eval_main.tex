\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{ch:eval}
This chapter will evaluate the prototypical implementation of the previous chapter \ref{ch:practical_realization}. 
It starts with locally self-made Docker images up to public Docker images from a container-registry, which will be processed by the prototype. The self-made images will purposely contain the RSA and AWS secrets, while it is not clear if the public ones will contain these types of secrets. The goal is to prove that the prototype is working for other public images as well.
The results of the locally images are shown quickly and a final result in relation to public images is briefly and concisely presented.
These results provide a good basis for a subsequent discussion, which takes place in the last section of the chapter.
The next section of this chapter will start as mentioned with creating Docker images locally.
