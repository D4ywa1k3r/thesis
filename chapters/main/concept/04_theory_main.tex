\chapter{A theoretical concept to analyze a docker image}
\label{ch:theory}
In this chapter the theoretical concept of detecting secrets in Docker images is evaluated and developed. 
Thus it begins with setting a scope of secrets to detect and hence introduce the method that has to be used to gain file access to images in general. 
Conclusively the process of image analysis is explained with the help of a suitable visualization.
