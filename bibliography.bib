	Abstract = {Containers are a widely successful technology today popularized by Docker. They improve system utilization by increasing workload density and enable seamless deployment of workloads across development, test, and production environments. Docker's unique approach to data management, which involves frequent snapshot creation and removal, presents a new set of exciting challenges for storage systems. At the same time, storage management for Docker containers has remained largely unexplored with a dizzying array of solution choices and configuration options. In this paper we unravel the multi-faceted nature of Docker storage and demonstrate its impact on system and workload performance. As we uncover new properties of the popular Docker storage drivers, this is a sobering reminder that widespread use of new technologies can often precede their careful evaluation.},

	Abstract = {Container technology has become an integral part of today's major IT services. Although it offers several benefits, it also introduces new challenges for operating and maintaining secure container environments. One such challenge is to retain the ability to detect and address the containers' vulnerabilities and compliance violations. However, designing an effective solution to enable this capability must be based on the accurate understanding of characteristics observed from actual container images and instances. To contribute toward this objective, we have built a general data processing framework, applying the principles of the state-of-the-art. It is a system that decouples the data collection process from the analysis so as to allow user to focus more on building new analysis logics rather than on the tools for monitoring agents. We applied it to the analysis of container images from the Docker Hub image repository, to learn about their security posture. In this work we present various interesting findings and new insights from analyzing the public image corpus. We have learned that more than 92{\%} of the images contain compliance violations and/or vulnerable packages.},

@article{Xu2018,
	Abstract = {It is feasible to deploy Docker containers in IoT (Internet of Things) devices because their runtime overhead is almost zero. Default Docker installation does not verify an image authenticity. Authentication is vital for users to trust that the image is not malicious or tampered with. As Docker is currently a popular choice for developers, tightening its security is a priority for system administrators and DevOps engineers. Docker recently deployed Notary as a solution to verify authenticity of their images. Notary is a viable solution, but it has some potential threats. This paper specifically addresses its vulnerability towards Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and propose a potential solution: blockchain-based Decentralized Docker Trust (DDT). The proposed solution involves decentralizing the trust via a blockchain. The solution greatly reduces the risk of DoS and at the same time provides a signature verification service for Docker images. We demonstrate the proposed blockchain-based solution's scalability and efficiency by conducting performance evaluation. At the same time, we also implemented a system prototype of Decentralized Docker Trust (DDT), and conducted performance evaluation for it on Amazon Web Services (AWS) across multiple data centers.},
