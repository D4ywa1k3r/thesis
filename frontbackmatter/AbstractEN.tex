\chapter*{Abstract}
Nowadays cloud native computing is becoming more and more popular. Especially Dockerâ€™s application containers are an essential part in cloud native computing and a critical member in this eco-system. 
Docker images are distributed arbitrarily in cloud environments or temporarily in other public or private container registries. This leads to problems if the developer has integrated some symmetric or asymmetric embedded secrets such as SSH keys, plaintext passwords, certificates, and many more.

The idea behind this work is to develop an approach to detect a secret RSA private key and an Amazon access token which are both commonly used by developers in an application container image. Related work is available for discovering secrets in source code in general but not in container images directly. This thesis shows an approach using Docker as an example to prove that an application of known key-leak techniques to detect embedded secrets is possible.
